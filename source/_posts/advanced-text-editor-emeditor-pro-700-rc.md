EmEditor Professional 7.00 RC 5 is available for download. The new features include:  
 – Bug fixes and optimizations.  
 – Since beta 41, even if “Tray Icon” is checked during the install, the tray icon will appear next time EmEditor is launched.  
 – It is recommended that previous versions are uninstalled before the new version is installed.  
 – Any previous RC verisons must be uninstalled before installing this version.  
 EmEditor Professional 7.00 RC 5 (Installer):  
[http://www.emeditor.com/pub/emed700rc5epx.msi](https://tools.techidaily.com/emeditor/products/) (32-bit)  
[http://www.emeditor.com/pub/emed700rc5ep64.msi](https://tools.techidaily.com/emeditor/products/) (64-bit)  
 The portable version can be produced from the Import/Export wizard on the Tools menu after you use the installer. However, the portable version runs slower than one using the Registry.  
 See [http://www.emeditor.com/modules/feature1/](https://tools.techidaily.com/emeditor/products/) for the list of new features.  
 Also, See the history page of the Help after you download and install the new version.  
 If you tried, please post any bug reports or any other feedback on this forum. Thank you!  
 Note: We will NOT add new features any more until Version 7 release, and will focus on optimization and bug fixes.  
 Recommended procedure:  
 1\. Close all EmEditor windows and the EmEditor Tray Icon on the Windows Task Bar.  
 2\. Uninstall previous version of EmEditor from Control Panel.  
 3\. Download and install this new version.  
 See [http://www.emeditor.com/modules/xoopsfaq/index.php?cat\_id=1#q1](https://tools.techidaily.com/emeditor/products/) for more details (except for download link).  
 \### This might be the last RC!

If I have a lot of documents open (‘open documents’ plugin is used)  
 and I click the top right ‘x’ to close the current document :  
 sometimes the wrong document is closed (i.e. not the one I’m currently looking at)  
 I think ctrl-f4 always works ok….

Of course it is a good news about “last RC”.  
 But so far I still have this:  
_The older version of EmEditor Professional (English) cannot be removed._  
 _Contact your technical support group._  
 Any suggestions from the “support group”? :-D

 Thanks for finding this serious bug. I will fix that.

 Can’t you install newer version on top of the older version, and uninstall so that everything will be uninstalled?

Well, this is THE PROBLEM, –  
 EmEditor during the installation of a new version at certain point  
 somehow detects existence of the “old version”,  
 which it cannot remove simply because that old version is not installed anymore :)  
 BUT somewhere in registry there are some **leftovers**  
 which indicate that the old virsion still installed.  
 That is why I’d like to see utility to **clenup registry** after EmEditor unistalled.

 I believe you should be able to select the old version from the Control Panel, and delete from the list. If this still does not work, I will search for a utility to instruct Windows just that when I have a time.

OK, I was able to install 6.004 **Free** version.  
 But it did not help to install 7.0 RC5/6,  
 because error message says about **Professional** version :-(

 Before you do this, make sure you save backup of the whole Registry of your system!! To do that, run regedit.exe, and select the root folder and right-click, Export.  
 Then search for “EmEditor” in data under HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionUninstall, and make a note of the key name, or copy to Notepad. The key name looks like {51371ACB-404F-471D-A669-D93BBC81F8B7}, but yours can be different. Delete that key, and also find the same key name in data and values in other places in the Registry, and if you find any, delete them also. I don’t guarantee this works, but you might want to try it.

OK, this did not help because I already tried to clean registry myself,  
 and got rid of all entries like ’emeditor’ and ’emed’ related to EmEditor.  
 I deleted relevant keys as well.  
 I decided to install v**7 RC6** on top of the v**6.004 free** and in the same folder ;-)  
 Of course, I received the same error, BUT now I have v**7 RC6** running :-D
