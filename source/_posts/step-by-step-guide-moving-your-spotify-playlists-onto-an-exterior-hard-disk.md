### Step 1 Import Spotify Playlist URL

Go to Spotify, get the Spotify playlist URL to this Spotify to hard drive downloader by copy-paste feature or by drag-drop feature. If you import a Spotify playlist URL, by default all the songs in the playlist will be supported for download, but if you do not want to download them all, just uncheck before the ones that you do not want to download.
