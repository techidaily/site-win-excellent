## Step-by-Step Guide: Moving Your Spotify Playlists Onto an Exterior Hard Disk

### Overview

* Can anyone tell me how I can download some Spotify playlist music to my hard drive for playback when I am travelling? I tried with my former Spotify downloader, but without success. Any idea?

Want to enjoy Spotify playlists in the car? Want to enjoy Spotify playlists from an external hard drive with a supported player? I think that many users have this need. On the other hand, we know that only Spotify subscribed users can download Spotify songs or playlists, and the downloaded Spotify songs or playlists are DRM-protected which means the downloaded Spotify songs or playlists can not be played outside of Spotify App. So how can we play the Spotify songs or playlists in car or on external hard drive with any supported player? Well, this playback need can be easily met with a professional Spotify to hard drive downloader - Allavsoft. Now let's learn how Allavsoft can help to play Spotify songs or playlists on external hard drive.
